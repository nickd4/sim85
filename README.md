Mirror of sim85-0.81.tar.gz downloaded from
https://sourceforge.net/projects/sim85, with some minor changes to get it to
build on my system

Note: Although it's quite well documented (see the /doc directory) and seems to
be well thought out, I discovered that it does not implement most CPU flags,
for instance the ADD instruction only seems to affect CF and not ZF or others.
